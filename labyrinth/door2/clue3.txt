You found the third clue ..


-- The answer to keyword three is going to be a little more dificult
-- We now have a slight issue .. we are stuck ..
-- How do we get back to where we just were .. 


-- Well, I think that we want to run cd <something> might be useful ..
-- we definitely want to change directories upwards since we are at a dead end
-- We want to change directory too .. I have no ideas, maybe something to do with dots ..
-- once you find what the <something> is, that is your third answer!
