You found the first clue!


-- Notice, when you did ls that there was another door,
-- and an answer.py file, the answer.py file will be for checking all your answers!
-- notice the door has no extension, its a directory!
-- we know we want to enter that door, it might take us somewhere!

-- to give you a hint, we want to go to door2 for now.

-- in order to do that we change to (c)hange (d)irectory to door2
-- the command is two letters I know that much ...
-- you will run _ _ door2


~= little help note, you can run the clear command if you want to clear the terminal of previous inputs and outputs
