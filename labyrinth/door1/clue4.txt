You found the 4th clue!


-- The answer to the -> 4th  keyword <- , is going to the name of this command
-- You will need to find this next clue, but be wary ...
-- I am letting you know doing cd .. and cd <dir> to find is going to be very tedious

-- However do not fret!

-- There is a command that lets you search for a file giving it a name to search for!
-- for syntax purposes the command is going to be formatted as follows
-- <command> . -name clue5.txt
-- hint its a four letter word, and is a synonym for search, also, the word exsits in this clue!

-- once you find the file, it will give you a path to the file, copy and paste that path and you can cat it!

-- to preface, the dot (.), specifies where to search from
-- optionally, you can choose to search from a specific directory instead of the dot (.)
-- once again the 4th keyword is the command in <command> . -name clue5.txt
