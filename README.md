# Linux Labyrinth

## Project Overview
**Linux Labyrinth** is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to explore and demonstrate the integration of a PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API. This project aims to show how to leverage Spring Boot to rapidly build a backend application that can interact with a PostgreSQL database. The application uses Java 17, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for data management, along with a Maven-based build system.

The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet scalable web application, showcasing the ease of setting up PostgreSQL, creating RESTful APIs, and implementing a database-driven application using Spring Boot.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: The application uses PostgreSQL as the database to store and retrieve application data, such as user data or any other relevant application information.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: The project leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment of the application. It provides features like automatic configuration, embedded Tomcat server, and Spring Data JPA for database access.
- **RESTful API**: The application exposes endpoints to interact with the data stored in the PostgreSQL database, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via HTTP requests.
- **Docker Support**: The project can be configured to run PostgreSQL in a Docker container, making it easier to set up a local development environment without the need for manual PostgreSQL installation.
- **UI**: An interractive web interface that makes the learning process engaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17, HTML & CSS**: programming languages used for this project.
- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework used to create the backend API and manage the applicationâ€™s configuration, security, and database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database management system used to store application data.
- **Maven**: The build tool used for managing dependencies, compiling, testing, and running the application.
- **Docker**: Used optionally for setting up PostgreSQL in a containerized environment, making the setup process easier.
