# Linux Labyrinth
## Project Overview
**Linux Labyrinth** is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to explore and demonstrate the integration of a PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API along with a fun an interractive game to learn about Linux/Unix-like commands. This project shows how to leverage Spring Boot to rapidly build a backend application that can interact with a PostgreSQL database. The application uses Java 17, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for data management, along with a Maven-based build system.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: The application uses PostgreSQL as the database to store and retrieve application data, such as user data or any other relevant application information.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: The project leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment of the application. It provides features like automatic configuration, embedded Tomcat server, and Spring Data JPA for database access.
- **RESTful API**: The application exposes endpoints to interact with the data stored in the PostgreSQL database, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via HTTP requests.
- **Docker Support**: The project can be configured to run PostgreSQL in a Docker container, making it easier to set up a local development environment without the need for manual PostgreSQL installation.
- **UI**: An interractive web interface that makes the learning process engaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17, HTML & CSS, JavaScript**: Programming languages used for this project.
- **Tailwind CSS, React, PostCSS**: Frontend technologies used for styling, building dynamic user interfaces, and optimizing CSS.
- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework used to create the backend API and manage the applicationâ€™s configuration, security, and database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database management system used to store application data.
- **Maven**: The build tool used for managing dependencies, compiling, testing, and running the application.
- **Docker**: Used optionally for setting up PostgreSQL in a containerized environment, making the setup process easier.

## Important Notes

- If you want to replicate this project and impliment it, be wary
- Since the users are inputting shell commands, no matter how much error checking there is it will (kind of) never be 100% secure
- Note on docker container, it is included in this project, I need to copy over game logic and some path resolving. Everything else is fully functional though, React and Spring Boot are both building and running, along with psql, you can create instances of users in the database via JPA entity automatically created by hibernate as in Spring Boot, spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto is automatically set to update if its not defined, this allows Hibernate to automatically create missing tables and/or columns based on Entity classes :)
